# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

| Day   | Deliverable                                  | Status     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Day 1 | Project Description, Wireframes, Priority    | Incomplete |
| DAY 1 | Matrix, Timeline                             |
| Day 2 | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete |
| Day 4 | MVP & Bug Fixes                              | Incomplete |
| Day 5 | Final Touches                                | Incomplete |
| Day 6 | Present                                      | Incomplete |

## Project Description

<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality. -->

The completion of this project will demonstrate my command over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by showcasing a website that will host subsequent projects. Ideally, you will find a sensible format with a professional presentation, functioning hyperlinks, and interactivity that one may expect from a junior developer.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

I feel like many of these layouts will be similar; I'm referencing the "Eloise Ress Barrow" wireframe and I think it'll be a popular design due to it's functionality and simplicity. There will be a navigation bar, an area for a quick introduction into our brand, a reference area to display our completed projects, and an area to share various contact methods. The idea with the mobile version, as with all versions really, is that you want this to be convenient for the person browsing. In a mobile setting, you'll want a seamless scrolling layout. Ideally, I'll be able to utilize the carousel function to display all my projects.

## Time/Priority Matrix

[Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/projaymmer/image/upload/v1633976311/Portfolio-Priority-Matrix-Scatter_nficea.png)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix. This involves drawing a a square. In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line. The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs. This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete.

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis. The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`. This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features. Continue to assign each feature a letter. Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter.

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
